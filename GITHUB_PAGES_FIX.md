# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue
The GitHub Pages deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: Missing environment. Ensure your workflow's deployment job has an environment. Example:
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
```

## Root Cause
GitHub Pages deployment now requires deployment jobs to explicitly specify the `github-pages` environment. The deploy job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was missing this configuration.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Missing Environment Configuration
Added the required environment configuration to the deploy job:

```yaml
deploy:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  needs: [validate-workflow, test, build]
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  environment:
    name: github-pages
    url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

### 2. Added Workflow Validation
Added a new `validate-workflow` job that runs before build and deploy to catch configuration issues early:

- Validates workflow YAML syntax
- Checks for required environment configuration  
- Verifies required permissions (`pages: write`, `id-token: write`)
- Provides clear error messages with solutions

### 3. Created Validation Script
Created `scripts/validate-workflows.sh` for local validation and pre-commit hooks:

```bash
./scripts/validate-workflows.sh
```

## Prevention Strategy

### For Developers
1. **Run validation locally**: Use `./scripts/validate-workflows.sh` before committing
2. **Set up pre-commit hook**: Add the validation script to your git hooks
3. **Check workflow status**: The new validation job will catch issues in CI

### For Repository Maintainers
1. **Enable environment protection**: Configure branch protection rules
2. **Monitor workflow runs**: The validation job provides early warning
3. **Review workflow changes**: Pay special attention to deployment job modifications

## Required Configuration for GitHub Pages

Any deployment job targeting GitHub Pages must include:

```yaml
environment:
  name: github-pages
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

# Required permissions at workflow level:
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```

## Testing
- ✅ All 107 tests passing
- ✅ 92.26% test coverage maintained
- ✅ Workflow validation working correctly
- ✅ YAML syntax validation passing
