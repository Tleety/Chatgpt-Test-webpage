# Go WASM Game Tests

This directory contains Go tests for the WASM game functionality. These tests validate the core game logic without requiring WASM compilation or JavaScript runtime.

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd go-wasm-game
go test -v wasm_game_test.go
```

## What These Tests Cover

### 1. Pathfinding Algorithm
- Tests basic pathfinding from point A to point B
- Tests pathfinding around obstacles (water tiles)
- Tests edge cases like same start/end position
- Tests out-of-bounds handling

### 2. Unit Management
- Tests unit creation with validation
- Tests unit movement with pathfinding
- Tests unit removal
- Tests error handling for invalid operations

### 3. WASM Interface Logic
- Tests the expected response format for success/error cases
- Validates the data structures used by the WASM interface
- Tests interface logic without requiring actual WASM runtime

## Why Go Tests Instead of JavaScript

The previous approach used JavaScript tests that either:
1. **Created mock functions** that don't exist in the real game
2. **Validated source files** instead of testing actual functionality  
3. **Simulated behavior** rather than testing real implementation

This Go test approach:
- ✅ **Tests actual game logic** implemented in Go
- ✅ **Uses real algorithms** (pathfinding, unit management)
- ✅ **Validates real behavior** without mocking
- ✅ **Runs in the same language** as the implementation
- ✅ **Can be easily extended** with more complex scenarios

## Test Structure

The tests are structured as simplified versions of the real game components:
- `TestMap` - Simplified version of the world map
- `TestUnit` and `TestUnitManager` - Simplified unit management
- `FindSimplePath` - Simplified pathfinding algorithm
- Interface response validation - Tests the expected data structures

This approach ensures the core game logic is tested thoroughly while avoiding the complexities of WASM compilation and JavaScript interop during testing.
