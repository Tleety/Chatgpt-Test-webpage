# Welcome to the Jekyll Page

This is a simple page built with **Jekyll**. It demonstrates how Jekyll can turn Markdown files into static websites using a layout. The layout file is shared at the repository root in `_layouts/default.html` and defines the basic HTML skeleton.

You can edit this page by modifying `index.md` inside the `jekyll-site` folder.
