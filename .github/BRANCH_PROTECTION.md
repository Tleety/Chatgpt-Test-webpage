# Branch Protection Setup Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Required Configuration for Test Enforcement

This repository includes workflows to run tests on pull requests, but **tests are not automatically enforced** without proper branch protection rules.

### Current Issue
PRs can be merged without waiting for tests to complete because GitHub's branch protection rules are not configured to require status checks.

### Required Setup Steps

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **Settings** (in the repository, not your profile)
   - Click **Branches** in the left sidebar

2. **Add Branch Protection Rule**
   - Click **Add rule**
   - Branch name pattern: `main`

3. **Enable Required Status Checks**
   - ✅ Check **"Require status checks to pass before merging"**
   - ✅ Check **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**
   - In the search box, add these status checks:
     - `PR Tests Required` (from pr-validation.yml)
     - `Unit Tests` (from ci.yml)

4. **Additional Recommended Settings**
   - ✅ **"Require a pull request before merging"**
   - ✅ **"Require conversation resolution before merging"**
   - ✅ **"Include administrators"** (apply rules to repo admins too)

### Verification

After setup, you should see:
- PRs show "Some checks haven't completed yet" if tests are running
- The **Merge pull request** button is disabled until all required checks pass
- A red ❌ appears next to the PR if tests fail, preventing merge

### Without This Setup

⚠️ **WARNING**: Without branch protection rules, pull requests can be merged immediately even if:
- Tests are still running
- Tests have failed
- No tests have run at all

This is why PR #80 was able to merge without test validation.

### Testing the Setup

After configuring branch protection:
1. Create a test PR
2. Verify the PR shows "Waiting for status checks" 
3. Ensure tests must complete before merge button becomes available
4. Try merging with failing tests (should be blocked)
